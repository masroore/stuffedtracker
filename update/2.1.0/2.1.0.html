Added:

+ Added optional IP-based tracking.
+ It is now possible to import the free MaxMind's geo database of countries in
  the tracker and see the countries of the visitors. A separate countries 
  report was added to the reports constructor.
+ Added click fraud detection and a separate log report that shows suspected
  fraudelent clicks and visitors.
+ Visitors path report now breaks the results into multiple pages for easier
  navigation.
+ Added support for timezones, including an option to automatically determine 
  the timezone of the user that currently browses tracker's control panel (very
  convenient with daylight saving time changes). To support this option, all
  dates are now stored in the database in GMT timezone and thus the dates in
  the database that were added before the upgrade to this version could be few 
  hours off.
+ Possibility to force tracker to use a directly supplied IP and visitor ID 
  during sales tracking.
+ Possibility to pass any custom information when logging a sale.  
+ Split tests now have an additional option to show the same page to the same
  visitor.
+ Added ignored IPs feature. All tracking requests coming from the specified
  IPs will be ignored.
+ It is now possible to generate multiple ad links for multiple keywords at
  once in the control panel and optionally export them in CSV format.
+ Added an ability to track actions by placing a specially generated tracking
  code inside a page.
+ Added income column to the split tests report.
+ Added visit length in the visitors path report.
+ It is now possible to limit number of sites that could be created for a 
  company in the Agency version.
+ It is now possible to specify the campaign name directly as a tracking 
  parameter. If a campaign with this name does not exist yet, it will be 
  automagically created by Stuffed Tracker.
+ It is now possible to change the names of all tracking parameters in the
  control panel (&src, &c, &k and &kw).  

Changed:

* A link to the path of one visitor located in the visitors path report now
  doesn't enforce the current date, so you can effectively see the complete 
  path of one visitor.
* Tracking only certain site's hosts is now optional, but can still be turned 
  on in the site's configuration.
* Page URL that is specified when an action is created is not forced to the 
  lower case any more.

Fixed:

* "Exclude paid traffic" setting in the natural traffic filter was working
  incorrectly.
* Fixed a redirect bug which caused a redirect to 'https' URL on Windows IIS 
  servers.
* Fixed a bug that caused tracker to use incorrect paths when a physical path
  on the server was different from the path used in the URL (this happend on 
  some shared SSL servers).
* Referrer was not shown in the visitor paths report for a split test.
* Search by IP in the visitors path report worked incorrectly in some cases.
* Other minor bugfixes
