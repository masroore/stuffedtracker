Added:

* PHP-based tracking
* Screen resolution statistics.(requires new Javascript tracking code to be used)
* Screen color statistics.(requires new Javascript tracking code to be used)
* Flash version statistics.(requires new Javascript tracking code to be used)
* Sorting in the log reports.
* Lots of different tracking modes are now available in Administration > 
  General settings. They allow to precisely control to which entry point a sale
  or an action is attributed to.
* Redirect-based ad links
* It is now possible to specify how many rows from the countries IP database
  to import per step.
* Possibility to specify a charset in personal settings of every user.
* It is now possible to specify subnets in the ignored IPs.
* PHP tracking could be switched off for a particular company in Agency version
  (useful if Stuffed Tracker is used as a service)
* It is now possible to create a demo user or demo administrator in the Agency 
  version. A demo user will not be able to update or change any information 
  in the database, but will have access to all other functions as usual.
* Showing the number of visitors online for every site (available on the
  company's home page).  
* Showing how many records are available in the log reports and what records
  are displayed on the current page.
* A domain for cookies can now be specified for every site, it will be used
  when a tracking cookie is set in the visitor's browser.

Changed:

* If mod_rewrite is enabled, Stuffed Tracker now generates static links
  for redirect-based actions and split-tests, thus making the links search 
  engine friendly.
* Changed the Javascript tracking code. The old code still works, but to 
  get the new stats for screen resolution, color and flash version a new
  code should be used. 

Fixed:

* A bug in split tests that prevented split tests that were pointing to a
  file that should be downloaded from working correctly.
* If the name of the visitor was specified then the name is shown everywhere 
  instead of the visitor ID.
* Tracking code now correctly works with sites that use frames (no double
  referrers any more). New Javascript tracking code is required for this to 
  work.
* If a particular date is specified in one of the log reports it is now 
  preserved in the visitor paths report too.
* Fixed a bug that caused 'field has no default value' error to appear in
  MySQL 5.0 working in a strict mode.
* Tracking code was not working when it was loaded inside a frame in Google
  images search.
