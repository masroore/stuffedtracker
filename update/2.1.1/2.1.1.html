Changed:

* Landing page URL in ad links generation does not require the domain 
  configured in the tracker any more.

Fixed:

* Sales were not tracked properly in certain circumstances.
* Split test statistics didn't show the query string for the pages if it was
  present.
* If "Always show the same page to the same visitor" option was enabled 
  for a split test and the url was deleted from the split test list, 
  the visitor was getting a blank page.
