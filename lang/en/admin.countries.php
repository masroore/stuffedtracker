In order to import or update countries to IPs information you would need to get
the latest CSV file with a <b>GeoLite free database</b> from
MaxMind (<a href=\"http://www.maxmind.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.maxmind.com</a>).<br><br>
You will download the database as a ZIP file. Unzip it, rename the CSV file to
\"country.csv\" and put it in the \"store\" folder inside the tracker's main
directory.<br><br>
To check that you have done everything correctly, you should refresh this page.
Information about the country.csv file should appear at the top of this page
next to the Import button.<br><br>
After this just click on the Import button and wait until the Progress bar will
reach 100% and \"Import is complete\" message is displayed.<br><br>
If you are importing the countries for the first time, you will need to go to
the \"Paid traffic reports settings\" and to the \"Natural traffic reports
settings\" and enable the \"Countries\" report there.
